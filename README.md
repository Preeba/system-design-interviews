## 🚀 Introduction
System design interviews test your ability to design scalable, reliable, and maintainable systems.  
This repo is my personal preparation guide, with concise explanations and example designs.

## 🔑 Key Topics
- **Scalability Basics** (load balancers, caching, databases, partitioning, replication)
- **Databases** (SQL vs NoSQL, indexing, sharding, transactions, CAP theorem)
- **Caching** (Redis, Memcached, CDN)
- **Messaging Systems** (Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS)
- **Storage** (file systems, blob storage, distributed storage)
- **Consistency & Availability** (eventual consistency, quorum, leader election)
- **Design Patterns** (microservices, event-driven, CQRS, pub/sub)
- **Security** (authentication, authorization, encryption, rate limiting)
