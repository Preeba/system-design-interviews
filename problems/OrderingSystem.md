# An **Ordering System for a POS (Point of Sale)** 
---

## üéØ **Goals & Requirements**

**Functional:**

* Staff can create/manage orders on POS devices.
* Orders contain multiple items with taxes, discounts.
* Update inventory in real time.
* Handle payments (cash, card, digital wallets).
* Support multiple stores, terminals.
* Support offline mode (POS must work even if network is down).

**Non‚ÄëFunctional:**

* Low latency (instant feedback at checkout).
* High availability (downtime = lost sales).
* Scalable (can handle many stores, thousands of orders/sec).
* Secure (PCI compliance for payments).
* Auditable (all transactions logged).

## üèó **High-Level Architecture**

```

## üîß **Components & Responsibilities**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **POS Client**

* Tablet/web/mobile app in store.
* Sends REST/GraphQL calls.
* Offline-first: cache orders locally in SQLite/IndexedDB when offline, sync later.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **API Gateway / Load Balancer**

* Handles authentication & routing.
* Ensures traffic is balanced across app servers.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Order Service**

* Create/update/cancel order.
* Apply taxes, discounts.
* Validate stock availability.
* Emits events (`ORDER_CREATED`, `ORDER_PAID`).

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Inventory Service**

* Tracks item stock across locations.
* Locks/reserves stock on order creation.
* Decrements stock on payment completion.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Payment Service**

* Integrates with card terminals and gateways (Stripe, Adyen, etc.).
* Handles PCI-sensitive data securely.
* Supports split payments, refunds.

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Databases**

* **Order DB:** Relational (Postgres/MySQL) for transactions.
* **Inventory DB:** Key-value or relational depending on complexity.
* **Caching:** Redis for frequently accessed catalog or stock info.

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **Event Bus (Kafka/RabbitMQ)**

* Asynchronously notify:

    * Analytics/BI systems.
    * Loyalty programs.
    * Notification service (send receipt by email/SMS).

---

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ **Supporting Services**

* **Catalog Service:** Manage products, prices, tax rules.
* **Auth Service:** Manage staff login and permissions.
* **Analytics:** Sales dashboards, real-time metrics.

---

## üåê **Data Flow Example**

**Placing an order:**

1. POS app ‚Üí `POST /orders` to Order Service.
2. Order Service:

    * Checks stock via Inventory Service.
    * Stores order (status = `pending`).
3. POS app ‚Üí `POST /payments` with order\_id.
4. Payment Service processes card:

    * On success ‚Üí update Order Service (status = `paid`).
    * Order Service emits `ORDER_PAID` event.
5. Inventory Service finalizes stock decrement.
6. Event Bus ‚Üí Analytics & Notifications.

## üì¶ **Sample Schema**

**orders**

| order\_id | store\_id | status | total\_amount | created\_at |
|-----------|-----------|--------|---------------|-------------|
| 12345     | 10        | paid   | 42.50         | 2025-07-17  |

**order\_items**

| order\_item\_id | order\_id | product\_id | qty | unit\_price |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------|-----|-------------|

**inventory**
| product\_id | store\_id | stock\_available | reserved\_stock |

---

## ‚ú® **Key Design Considerations**

‚úÖ **Offline Mode:**

* POS app queues orders locally and syncs later with an idempotent API (same order\_id won‚Äôt double-create).

‚úÖ **Scalability:**

* Stateless services behind load balancer.
* Event-driven architecture (Kafka) for downstream processing.

‚úÖ **Resilience:**

* Circuit breakers and retries for payment gateway.
* Redundant replicas of DB.

‚úÖ **Security:**

* PCI compliance for card data.
* Encrypt sensitive data.
