Here’s a structured **System Design for Shopify** (an e‑commerce platform) along with **database choices** and reasoning:

---

## 🛒 **High‑Level Requirements**

* Multi‑tenant platform: millions of independent stores.
* Handle product catalogs, orders, inventory, payments.
* Scalable search and fast checkout.
* Highly available, low latency worldwide.
* Support analytics (sales reports, dashboards).

---

## 📐 **High‑Level Architecture**

## 🗃 **Data Types in Shopify**

1. **Store metadata** (merchant info, store settings)
2. **Product catalog** (product name, price, variants, images)
3. **Orders** (cart, checkout, payment status, fulfillment)
4. **Inventory** (stock levels, warehouse info)
5. **Search** (for products)
6. **Media assets** (images, videos)
7. **Analytics** (sales data, events)

---

## 💾 **Database Choices**

| Data Type                           | Suggested DB                                   | Why                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Store & Product metadata**        | **Relational DB (PostgreSQL or MySQL/Aurora)** | ACID guarantees, transactional integrity for catalog and store settings. |
| **Orders & Transactions**           | **Relational DB (Aurora / Spanner)**           | Strong consistency required for payment and order workflows.             |
| **Inventory (high‑volume updates)** | **Cassandra / DynamoDB**                       | High write throughput, low latency updates, globally distributed.        |
| **Search (products)**               | **Elasticsearch / OpenSearch**                 | Full-text search, filtering, autocomplete.                               |
| **Media assets (images, videos)**   | **Object Storage (S3, GCS)**                   | Large files served via CDN.                                              |
| **Caching layer**                   | **Redis / Memcached**                          | Low-latency reads for product data, session info.                        |
| **Analytics (events, logs)**        | **BigQuery / Snowflake / Redshift**            | OLAP workloads, complex queries over sales/events.                       |

---

## ✨ **Other Components**

* **Message Queue/Event Bus**: Kafka or RabbitMQ to handle events like “Order Placed,” “Inventory Updated,” “Email Confirmation.”
* **CDN**: CloudFront/Akamai for fast static asset delivery.
* **Microservices**: Separate services for catalog, checkout, order management, payments, etc.
* **Payment Gateway Integration**: Stripe, internal gateway, PCI compliant.

---

## 🔑 **Multi‑Tenant Strategy**

Shopify serves many merchants from a shared infrastructure:

* **Tenant Isolation**:

    * Either row-level (store\_id in each table) in a shared DB, or
    * Separate databases per region/tenant for very large merchants.
* **Sharding**: Partition databases by store\_id or region.

---

## 🚀 **Example Data Flow**

1. Buyer browses a store → **Storefront Service** fetches product data from **PostgreSQL** (cached in Redis), images from **S3**, search via **Elasticsearch**.
2. Buyer adds to cart → Cart stored in **Redis** (session), then persisted in Orders DB on checkout.
3. Buyer checks out → **Checkout Service** performs transaction in **Orders DB**, updates **Inventory DB** via async event (Kafka), triggers emails.

---

## 📊 **Recommended DB Combo**

✅ **PostgreSQL or Aurora** → Stores, Products, Orders
✅ **DynamoDB or Cassandra** → Inventory and high‑scale attributes
✅ **Elasticsearch** → Search
✅ **Redis** → Caching
✅ **S3 (or GCS)** → Images and media
✅ **Snowflake/BigQuery** → Analytics and reporting

---
Got it! Let’s dive into **event‑driven order & inventory updates** in a Shopify‑like system design.

---

## ✨ **Why event‑driven?**

In e‑commerce, many things happen after an order is placed:

* Update inventory stock.
* Send confirmation emails.
* Trigger payment capture.
* Start fulfillment workflows.
* Update analytics.

Doing all of these **synchronously** during checkout would slow down the customer experience and tightly couple services.

✅ **Event‑driven** means:

* The **Order Service** publishes an **OrderPlaced** event.
* Other services (Inventory, Notification, Analytics, etc.) **subscribe** and react independently.

---

## 📦 **Key Components**

| Component                                | Role                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Order Service**                        | Handles checkout, writes order to DB, publishes `OrderPlaced` event. |
| **Event Bus** (Kafka, RabbitMQ, SNS/SQS) | Transports events reliably.                                          |
| **Inventory Service**                    | Listens to `OrderPlaced`, updates stock in inventory DB.             |
| **Notification Service**                 | Listens to `OrderPlaced`, sends email/SMS.                           |
| **Analytics Service**                    | Listens to `OrderPlaced`, logs data for reports.                     |

---

## 🔄 **Flow: Order & Inventory Update**

1. **User Checkout**

    * User clicks **Buy**.
    * Checkout Service creates order in **Orders DB (PostgreSQL)**.
    * Publishes `OrderPlaced` event with payload:

      ```json
      {
        "order_id": "123",
        "items": [
          { "sku": "A1", "qty": 2 },
          { "sku": "B2", "qty": 1 }
        ],
        "customer_id": "789"
      }
      ```

2. **Event Bus**

    * The message is sent to Kafka/RabbitMQ topic `order.events`.
    * This ensures durability and allows multiple consumers.

3. **Inventory Service**

    * Subscribes to `order.events`.
    * On `OrderPlaced`, it:

        * Deducts stock in **Inventory DB (Cassandra/DynamoDB)**.
        * Emits another event like `InventoryUpdated` if needed.

4. **Notification Service**

    * Subscribes to `order.events`.
    * Sends order confirmation email/SMS.

5. **Analytics Service**

    * Subscribes to `order.events`.
    * Updates dashboards and sales reports asynchronously.

---

## ⚡ **Benefits**

✅ Loose coupling between services.
✅ Each service scales independently.
✅ Failures in one consumer (e.g., Analytics) don’t block checkout.
✅ Easier to add new features (just add a new consumer).

---

## 📋 **Example Topics**

* `order.placed`
* `order.canceled`
* `inventory.updated`
* `payment.failed`

---

Here you go! In a distributed, event‑driven system (like Shopify’s order/inventory services), **idempotency** is critical so that if an event is delivered twice (or retried after a failure), the state remains correct.

Below are **battle‑tested idempotency strategies** you can use:

---

## ✅ **1. Use an Idempotency Key**

**How it works:**

* Each event or API call carries a unique identifier (`event_id` or `request_id`).
* Before applying the action, check if you’ve already processed that ID.
* If yes → **skip** or return the previous result.

**Implementation:**

* Maintain a **ProcessedEvents** table or cache:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE processed_events (
    event_id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
    processed_at TIMESTAMP
  );
  ```
* When processing an event:

    * `SELECT` for that `event_id`.
    * If not found → process → `INSERT`.
    * If found → skip.

**Where:** Payment Service, Order Service, Inventory Updates.

---

## ✅ **2. Upserts (Insert‑or‑Update)**

Instead of blindly inserting:

* Use **upsert** (`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT UPDATE` in PostgreSQL, `put_item` in DynamoDB) so repeated writes simply overwrite or no‑op.

**Example:**

```sql
INSERT INTO inventory (sku, stock)
VALUES ('A1', 100)
ON CONFLICT (sku) DO UPDATE
SET stock = EXCLUDED.stock;
```

**Benefit:** Reapplying the same state doesn’t break consistency.

---

## ✅ **3. Idempotent State Machines**

* Model your service as a state machine (e.g., Order: `PENDING → PAID → FULFILLED`).
* Before applying a transition, **check current state**:

    * If already in target state → skip.
    * If transition invalid → ignore or alert.

**Example:**

* If an `InventoryReserved` event arrives twice:

    * Inventory Service checks if `reservation_status = RESERVED` already.
    * If yes, do nothing.

---

## ✅ **4. Deduplication Window**

In event streaming platforms (Kafka, Kinesis):

* Use a **deduplication layer**:

    * Cache recent `event_id`s in Redis for N hours.
    * Ignore duplicates within that window.

---

## ✅ **5. Exactly‑once processing with DB transactions**

* Wrap event processing and deduplication record insert in a **single transaction**:

  ```pseudo
  BEGIN
    IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM processed_events WHERE event_id = :id)
    THEN
      -- process logic
      INSERT INTO processed_events (event_id, processed_at) VALUES (:id, now());
    END IF;
  COMMIT
  ```
* Guarantees that if transaction commits, event was processed exactly once.

---

## ✅ **6. Idempotent APIs for external calls**

If your service calls others:

* Pass the same idempotency key in headers (`Idempotency-Key: <uuid>`).
* Downstream services should implement the same deduplication logic.

---

### ✨ **Practical example: Inventory Service**

Event payload:

```json
{
  "event_id": "order-123-reserve-A1",
  "sku": "A1",
  "qty": 2
}
```

Steps:

1. Check `processed_events` for `order-123-reserve-A1`.
2. If not present → decrement stock in DB with upsert → add `order-123-reserve-A1` to processed\_events.
3. If present → log and skip.

---

### 📌 **Combine Strategies**

✅ **Idempotency Key + Processed Table** (most common)
✅ **State checks** (avoid invalid transitions)
✅ **Upserts** (avoid duplicates)
