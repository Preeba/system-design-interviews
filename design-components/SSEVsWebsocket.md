# **Server-Sent Events (SSE) vs WebSockets**

## SSE vs WebSockets

### **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**

* **Protocol**: Built on top of standard HTTP (one-way stream).
* **Direction**: Server â†’ Client only (unidirectional).
* **Transport**: Text/event-stream over HTTP.
* **Use case**:

    * Real-time updates that only flow *from server to client*.
    * Examples: live sports scores, stock tickers, notification feeds.
* **Pros**:

    * Simple (works over plain HTTP).
    * Automatic reconnection built-in.
    * Lower overhead than WebSockets for one-way data.
* **Cons**:

    * No client â†’ server push (client must still use HTTP requests).
    * Limited browser support for binary data (mostly text).

---

### **WebSockets**

* **Protocol**: Upgrades HTTP connection to a full-duplex TCP connection.
* **Direction**: Bi-directional (Client â†” Server).
* **Transport**: Works outside HTTP after the initial handshake.
* **Use case**:

    * Real-time applications needing **two-way communication**.
    * Examples: chat apps, collaborative editing, multiplayer games.
* **Pros**:

    * True two-way, low-latency communication.
    * Supports text and binary data.
* **Cons**:

    * More complex to implement and scale (stateful connections).
    * Requires load balancer / infra that supports sticky sessions.

### **When to use what**

* **Use SSE** if â†’ You only need **server â†’ client streaming updates** (simpler, lightweight).
* **Use WebSockets** if â†’ You need **two-way, interactive communication** or binary data.

ðŸ‘‰ Example in TicketMaster context:

* **SSE**: Notify users in the virtual waiting queue about their position or when seats become available.
* **WebSocket**: Enable **real-time collaboration** (e.g., friends picking seats together, chat with support).

### **Comparison table (SSE vs WebSocket)** 

Hereâ€™s a crisp **comparison table** you can keep in mind for interviews:

| Feature          | **SSE (Server-Sent Events)**               | **WebSockets**                          |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Protocol**     | HTTP (text/event-stream)                   | HTTP upgrade â†’ persistent TCP           |
| **Direction**    | One-way (Server â†’ Client)                  | Two-way (Client â†” Server)               |
| **Data type**    | Text (UTF-8)                               | Text & Binary                           |
| **Complexity**   | Simple to implement                        | More complex (connection mgmt, scaling) |
| **Scalability**  | Easier (uses plain HTTP infra)             | Harder (needs sticky sessions / state)  |
| **Reconnects**   | Built-in auto-reconnect                    | Must be handled manually                |
| **Best for**     | Notifications, feeds, streaming updates    | Chats, games, collaborative apps        |
| **Limitations**  | No client â†’ server push, no binary support | More overhead, harder to load-balance   |

---

ðŸ‘‰ **Rule of thumb**:

* Use **SSE** when you only need server-to-client updates (lighter, simpler).
* Use **WebSockets** when you need true two-way communication.

ðŸ‘‰ **Rule of Thumb for Interviews**:

* **HTTP/REST** â†’ simple APIs.
* **gRPC** â†’ service-to-service comms.
* **WebSockets** â†’ real-time, interactive.
* **SSE** â†’ server push only.
* **MQTT/AMQP** â†’ pub/sub messaging.
* **TCP/UDP/QUIC** â†’ transport-level trade-offs (latency vs reliability).
